# Retail Sales Prediction Case Study

This project presents a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting retail sales using cleaned warehouse data. The pipeline includes sampling, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment using a Streamlit app.


- Data sampling (40% and 30%)
- Feature selection and cleaning
- Model training and evaluation
- Regression models: Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Model tuning with GridSearchCV
- Saving/loading models with Joblib
- Deployment using Streamlit

## Files Included

- `Retail_Sales_Prediction_case_Study.pdf`: Full case study notebook (PDF)
- `app.py`: Streamlit application for predicting retail sales

## How to Run the App

1. Install Streamlit if not already installed:
